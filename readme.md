## About the project

I created a service in Azure AI Vision Studio and experimented with some uses of artificial intelligence, such as recognizing a face, a text, describing what is happening in an image, and searching for an event/object in a video.
  
## **How to get started**

First, I clicked on "Create a resource" and created a new "Cognitive Service". After that, I simply selected my resource group that I had previously created in the [previous challenge](https://github.com/GianDutra/Machine-Learning-no-Azure-ML), chose a name that I thought was suitable, and the "Standard S0" plan. After that, I waited and in less than 1 minute I had already created a resource on [Vision Studio website](https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/).

### **Step two**

I initiated the studio as you can see in the photo, I chose the "Automated ML" option and created a new automated ML job. Next, I put in a name I thought was suitable for my project, a name for my experiment, and a description. After that, I chose to perform regression because I wanted to predict a numerical value. I selected "Tabular" as the data asset type, imported a .csv file that I wanted to experiment with, and processed the data to see if it was in the correct format. Finally, I chose the primary metric "NormalizedRootMeanSquaredError" and allowed the "RandomForest" and "LightGBM" models, setting in the limits tab the respective values of: 3, 3, 3, 0.085, 15, 15, and enabling early termination, in addition to choosing the validation option called "Training validation split".

## Final Considerations
In this project, I learned a lot about Azure Machine Learning, and although I already had some experience in Machine Learning through courses and projects, it was really cool to see how easy, fast, and advanced this matter is within Azure. I will definitely use these services again if I need to perform a regression or any other task, and I'm excited for my next learning opportunity.
